I don't even know what's the intent of this project. .NET is cool.
Based upon ioquake3.

Some of the major features currently implemented are:

  * SDL backend
  * OpenAL sound API support (multiple speaker support and better sound
    quality)
  * Full x86_64 support on Linux
  * VoIP support, both in-game and external support through Mumble.
  * MinGW compilation support on Windows and cross compilation support on Linux
  * AVI video capture of demos
  * Much improved console autocompletion
  * Persistent console history
  * Colorized terminal output
  * Optional Ogg Vorbis support
  * Much improved QVM tools
  * Support for various esoteric operating systems
  * cl_guid support
  * HTTP/FTP download redirection (using cURL)
  * Multiuser support on Windows systems (user specific game data
    is stored in "%APPDATA%\Quake3")
  * PNG support
  * Many, many bug fixes

The map editor and associated compiling tools are not included. We suggest you
use a modern copy from http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/.
