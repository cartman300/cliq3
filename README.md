I don't even know what's the intent of this project. .NET is cool.
Based upon ioquake3.

Some of the major features and changes since ioquake3 fork are:

  * No support for other operating systems besides Windows (i call it a feature)

The map editor and associated compiling tools are not included. We suggest you
use a modern copy from http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/.
